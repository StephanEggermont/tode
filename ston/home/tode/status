    Issue #37: as part of the script sharing work, I am merging the filesystem and objectSystem into a seamless whole...once you\'ve spliced a file system \"mount point\" into the objectory (object directory) you should be able to `cp` and `rsync` objects and files back and forth (with some initial limitiations) objects are stored in STON format on disk and disk entities have a TDFileSystemNode that represents them ... I\'ve filled out the basic apis without a lot of testing ...
