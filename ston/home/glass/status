    work to improve definition diff capabilities:
    
    Add UseTimeStampInComparisons class var to MCMethodDefinition to control whether or not the method timeStamp is significant or not during equality comparisons.
    
    useful printString defined for MCConflict>>printOn:.
    
    use #trimBoth on source in MCMethodDefinition>>= ... no need to generate diffs because of trailing separators.
